DECENTRASEC: Secure & Transparent Research Paper Registry on Blockchain
 The Future of Academic Integrity, Decentralization, and AI-Powered Research Validation is Here! 

⚡ The Problem: A Broken Research System
🔴 Plagiarism & Fake Research – Countless fraudulent research papers make it into academia due to weak validation.
🔴 Centralized Gatekeepers – Publishing houses & centralized repositories control the research ecosystem.
🔴 Manipulated Peer Reviews – Unverified citations & biased reviews lead to untrustworthy scientific advancements.
🔴 Data Tampering & Ownership Disputes – Who really owns a research paper? Traditional publishing lacks immutable proof.

🔥 Our Solution: AI-Driven Blockchain Research Validation
🌍 DecentraSec is an immutable, decentralized research registry that integrates blockchain security with AI-powered validation to ensure research integrity, transparency, and proof-of-authorship.
🚀 How It Works? 1️⃣ Smart Contract-Based Paper Uploading – Every research paper is permanently stored on Anryton Blockchain via smart contracts, ensuring unalterable ownership records.
2️⃣ IPFS-Backed Storage – Papers are uploaded to InterPlanetary File System (IPFS), providing decentralized, tamper-proof accessibility.
3️⃣ AI-Powered Paper Validation – Every submission undergoes AI-based research quality analysis for plagiarism detection, originality scoring, and authenticity verification.
4️⃣ On-Chain Verification & Tokenized Rewards – Verified researchers receive blockchain-stamped validation proofs, and institutions can reward credible research via Web3 incentives.
5️⃣ Decentralized Peer Review – Our model enables permissionless, blockchain-verified peer reviews, ensuring trust in research without central authority control.
